# Description: A bash script that is capable of performing addition and subtraction calculations on two integers. It has two modes of operation; no parameters or with three parameters. 
# If no parameters are passed it displays a menu allowing the user to input a choice, program utilizes a variety of selection structures in order to handle user input.
# The program performs error checking and correctly assigns operation based off user input. If three parameters are provided the second paramter must be either "+" or "-" and the remaining
# must be integers only. If the incorrect number of parameters are provided the script will display an error message. 
# exit the program.
